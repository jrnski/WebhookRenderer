This is a simple App created with replit that calls a n8n webhook, fetched the response. The "response" of the json object will be rendered into the field below the form.

I added some fancy loading animations :)

From here you can create complex forms, interactions, test and production environments, add databases, logins etc. to build a complete Agent as a Service tool. 

Change your webhook in server/routes.ts
